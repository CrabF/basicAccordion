                We provide front-end challenges that include professional web
                designs. These allow you to practice building websites in a
                realistic workflow. Taking these challenges will help you
                improve your skills, gain experience creating websites, and
                build up an incredible project portfolio. We also have a large
                community of developers, so it's a great way to meet other devs!

                The majority of our challenges are free, yes. We do have some
                that are premium and require a Pro subscription to access. It
                will say on each challenge whether they are free or premium, so
                it's easy to tell the difference.

                The best (and quickest) way to get help on a challenge is in our
                Discord server. There are thousands of other developers in
                there, so it's a great place to ask questions. We even have a
                dedicated "help" channel! If you haven't joined yet, you can get
                an invite to our Discord server here.
